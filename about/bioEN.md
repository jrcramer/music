Jaap Cramer (*1984, Amersfoort, Netherlands) showed interest in music at an early age by playing piano along side classical cds and recordings. He began piano lessons at the age of five and started altering the piano pieces he learned. Not much later, he scribbled down his first compositions.   
At age eleven Jaap got his first composition lessons from Nico Ph. Hovius, who taught him the basics of harmony, counterpoint, form, orchestration, and solfege. Jaap studied the oboe and organ for two years and used his skills as an organist, playing for several different churches before beginning University studies.

In 2002 Jaap started a study Molecular Sciences at the University of Wageningen. During that period, all private musical studies were discontinued. Despite having no professional guidance, Jaap continues studying music on his own, exploring more contemporary techniques.  
In 2004 Jaap discontinued his studies in Wageningen to focus on Theology. In February 2013 he received his Masters degree Theology on the Theological University of the Reformed Churches, Kampen. Currently he is working as a part-time minister in Heerde, combining work in church with writing music.

In December 2014 the work [Wanneer Hij komt]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-12-06-wanneer %}) (for triple choir, strings and organ) won the first ArsMusica competition contest.
