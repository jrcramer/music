Part of a kickstarter project: [Beauty and Hope](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2925155/beauty-and-hope-in-the-21st-century) in the 21th century.  

The entire project consists of 9 pieces for piano, written by 9 different composers, from which I was one. Each composer picked one of nine different images, also made for this project, to draw inspiration.  
I was lucky to work with the amazing image *Puddle* by Piero Pierini.
