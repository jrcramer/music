Motet for SATB and Organ. Written for the 2013 edition of the [Hinsz Composition Concours](http://www.hinszconcours.nl), finalist entry.

The texts deals with the confusion of languages. miBavel is Hebrew for *"Out of Babylon"*. Babel was the place where the confusion of languages happened, and at the same time the place where the people of Israel was exiled.
By juxtaposing texts from different theological traditions, this work is a prayer that people who are currently exiled in miscommunication, may return.
