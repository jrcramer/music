*Setting of Phos Hilarion and Baruch HaMapil*  
Written for the 2016 Rautavaara Contest Helsinki Choir (SMATBB)

## Program notes
Drawing from ancient texts, a Christian hymn in Greek, and a Jewish prayer in Hebrew, this work tries to get both religions in dialogue. Both texts are sung or said in the evening, just before sleep and are set using different musical textures. The *Phos Hilaron* uses homophony with quintal and mirrored harmonies, while the *haMapil* uses a canonic texture with hexachordal harmonies. Together with the polyrhythms this paints the difficulty of dialogue. 

This clashes when the female voices arive at a a static moment, praising the trinity, a highlight in christian theology; which from a Jewish
perspective is nothing but an bad dream.  
There is however overlap in both texts, the light (Φῶς, l.1 and וְהָאֵר 3 times in l.6-8), a moment where the immortality of God is juxtaposed with the mortality of men.  
At a certain point both prayers seem to agree with each other, even to the extent that the texture of the male voices become more homophonic, and the female voices break out of their rigid homophony.
The coda surrenders to sleep, as a lullaby is supposed to do. The question remains whether the dialogue is put to rest.
